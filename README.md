# Get the environment running

I'll try and do most things in one conda environment. The details of what that looks like are in the `environment.yml` file.

```bash
conda env create environment.yml
```

# Raw Data

The raw data are located here:

```bash
raw_data="/home/raw_data/MM/2025_long_reads/ONT_gDNA192_1071_RL/E_Phylacis/20251117_1227_2C_PBE85256_e040940c/"
```
